# Little Holland Project

## Project Description
Little Holland aims to develop VST3 and AU2 plugins that track MIDI notes and audio data transferred between the plugins and an AI server. The plugins are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux ARM64.

## Challenges
Creating AI capable of music composition involves formalizing subjective perception, which is a significant hurdle due to the artistic and fuzzy nature of music.
