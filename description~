Hey, my  friend! Today we start a project named Little Holland. This is one of the projects by SystematicLabs from 
Estonia, Tallin. Idea and MVP develop by Vladimir Ovcharov and AI Assistant, welcome to the board, collegue!   
We start from the scratch and This is your task. You create an description of this task: "Write a vst3 and AU2 
plugins with simple framework interface shows number of midi notes being transfered to AI server and number of 
notes transfered back to the current track. Each type of plugins (au2 and vst3) can be midi or audio. 
In case of audio plugin it has to show number of data in Mb transfered in and out to AI server.   

Beta testers are musicians with proven tracks in musical composing and songwriting. They are Subjective perciption 
department and Deeps machine learning Crue. Thei task will be selecting music in contemporary electronic music and bonding 
them to genres and create description of subjective insights that music brings in. The second part of beta tester's 
job will be composing music to highlight the cases with "extra vibe states". This moment will be deassembled by the 
analyser (the part of a development) to a smaller valuable pieces to make AI be able to recreate the the same conditions 
and finally create a small piece of music which is separate instrument track in MIDI or in audio.

What is Little Holland? Little Holland is a AI model based on LLM learned to generate MIDI or Audio track using 
VST3/AU2 plugins connected to each track including master track, and sends all data via tcp/ip to AI server 
https://littleholland.overtheworld.uk using API and UDP for realtime protocol transport. So, basically it can play any
instrument inside given musical environment (key {Am,F#}, tune {minor, major, lidian, etc.}, rythme {straignt, swing,
shuffle}, and control the output during change any of the parameters.  

How it learns? It learns highly effective cause while adjusting midi parameters to achieve "zero state sound" or 
writing a notes of the resulting feedback as a listener, aiming to create the same enviromental patterns using infinite combination 
of musical instruments like synthesisors, samplers both software and hardware.

How it compose music?
It is a pure magic, we do not know how it works. It is a joke, no really.

MVP includes: VST3 macos apple silicon plugin code, all descriptions and daemon app for linux arm64. VST3 do serialization of data, 
open ip connection with server api, wait for data stream to begin then deserialise and store transmited midi data as a file {track name}.midi in folder 
named as session-id {date + 3 random digits + client DAW id string), and file parameters.csv with parameters inluded in other fields.
 
Create single deploing script includes

1. config file (littleholland.conf), declasre all input variables we use in app before it runs.
2. README.md (Create project description using best practicies)
 - create a annotation of a project, decribe one of the hardest challenges in AI is a music creation ability of a AI, because this is art with fuzzy rules and subjective perception which is crusual hurdle infront of the AI today.    
 - subjective perception can be measured, can be formalised, but only replay, replay or repeat by the approach to the same environmental parameters which will be detected during the learning process
3. Search related to Artificial Intellegence scientific articles in the archive.org and include in the README 20 of the most tangled with AI's ability to create music   
4. Daemon app for Linux arm64 version. This is server app with secure API, constantly listens all availiable network interfaces 
for requests from plugins.   
5. Windows x32/x64 version. Generate code of VST3 plugin to transfer  MIDI via tcp/ip to server address littleholland.overtheworld.uk.
6. MacOS Apple Silicon CPU version. Generate code of VST3 plugin to transfer  MIDI via tcp/ip to server address littleholland.overtheworld.uk. 
7. Create a UML components diagram for plugin app
8. All 
8. Create deamon app for linux arm64.

Use case: 

Create server API description.
Structure of received data:
1. session id (indicates tracks of the same session and set users permissions)
2. Real time Data type {midi, audio}
3. Raw data
4.
